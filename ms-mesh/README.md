# ms-mesh

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run src/index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.7. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.

If you experience build issues ([related issue](https://github.com/Urigo/graphql-mesh/pull/1564)), you might be missing python 2:

```bash
$ pyenv install 2.7.18
```
